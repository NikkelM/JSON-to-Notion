# Import JSON files to Notion

![JSON to Notion banner](images/JSONToNotionBanner.png)

Utility that is able to "import" JSON files to Notion - for cases where a CSV file is simply not available, and the conversion from JSON to CSV would be too complicated.

## Setup 

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies first.

Following this, create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project and fill it with your desired [configuration](#configuration).

If you haven't already done so, you can obtain a Notion integration key by creating an (internal) Notion integration for your workspace.
You can follow [this guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) to learn how to do so.
You will need this key to run the integration locally.

**IMPORTANT: Don't forget to connect the integration to your database, as described in the guide! Otherwise, the import won't work.**

## Usage

After providing the `config.json` [configuration](#configuration) file, you can run the script using

```bash
node index.js
```

The script will now automatically import the specified JSON properties to your Notion database.

## Configuration

### Schema validation

The project provides an extensive JSON validation schema for the required configuration file.
This makes sure that the script is able to run without any issues.

The schema can be found in the `config.schema.json` file and used within your `config.json` by adding the following property:

```json
"$schema": "config.schema.json"
```

*NOTE: The script will test your provided `config.json` against this schema, so make sure your configuration is valid.*

### Properties

The following is a list of all configuration items, their defaults and the values they can take.

If you are using Notion to organize your Steam game library, you might be interested in the [Notion Steam API integration](https://github.com/NikkelM/Notion-Steam-API-Integration) project, an integration that automatically retrieves information for Notion entries that contain a Steam App ID.

Similarly, you can use the [Game Pass API](https://github.com/NikkelM/Game-Pass-API) to retrieve information about all games currently available on Game Pass, and then import that information using this tool.
